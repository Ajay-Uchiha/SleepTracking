PROBLEM STATEMENT 
   With growing awareness of the importance of quality 
sleep for both mental and physical health, there is a need for accessible 
tools that help individuals monitor and improve their sleep habits. Many 
existing solutions are either too complex or lack a user-friendly interface 
that promotes consistent usage. As a result, individuals may not have 
access to easy-to-understand insights on their sleep patterns, making it 
challenging to address sleep-related issues effectively. This project aims to 
address this gap by developing a straightforward and engaging sleep 
tracking app that provides actionable insights into sleep quality and 
duration. 
 
SOLUTION 
   The Sleep Tracker app provides a minimalist, easy-to
use platform for users to monitor and improve their sleep habits. Using 
Jetpack Compose for an intuitive UI, the app enables users to start a sleep 
timer, record their sleep duration, rate their sleep quality, and view daily 
and historical analyses of their sleep patterns. The app's data visualization 
offers insights into trends, helping users recognize patterns that may 
impact their sleep. Future enhancements, such as smart alarms and health 
metric integration, will make the app a comprehensive solution for those 
looking to enhance their sleep quality through accessible technology. 
Good quality sleep is essential for physical and mental health, and lack of 
sleep can lead to various health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, and depression. By using a sleep tracking app, you 
can identify areas where you may be falling short in terms of sleep 
hygiene, and make adjustments accordingly. In addition to improving your 
sleep quality, a sleep tracking app can also help you identify underlying 
sleep disorders or health issues that may be affecting your sleep.
